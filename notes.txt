-seamless transition between singleplayer and multiplayer experience; continuous scaling of playerbase size
	-playable areas increase/decrease by available players
-fake players: pseudo-turing-complete ai through limited game scope
-incremental with data vis
-persistent playermade structures, machines, etc
	-everything is an input/output machine
	-players output can become other players' input
	-builds into a massive network
	-players can log in at any time to see progress, collect output, whatever
-chess/stratego type game
-open world td
-scaling network performance (like eve online)


open world 2d rust
casual arcade-y platform brawler
-suuuper simple fast-paced mechanics
br rpg
- key: min-maxing stats by farming until endgame, balanced with PVP

Open world TD
- Core Features
	- procedurally generated world
	- specified sites where new players can start
	- your base generates creeps
	- can upgrade creeps to different types, levels, etc
	- big emphasis on routing creeps
		- switchable gates
		- pressure plates, redstone-like circuits
	- wave manipulation (building up big bursts to send at enemies/objectives)
	- neutral monster spawns for gold
	- neutral minibosses
	- pre-built pathways
		- editing lanes? (game design decision)
	- boss spawns?
	- more strongholds unlock as players go online
		- do they also shrink later? or stay open based on historical peak
- Added depth post-MVP
	- really compelling notification integration
		- mobile push, email, sms
		- configurable emergency notifications
		- daily/weekly digest/summary/customized newsletter
		- stats and graphs and numbers
	- action replay of important events while you were gone (?)
	- global map (show player/origin point levels, color coded numbers)
- Gameplay
	- Strongholds
		- Source of spawning creeps
		- Leveled up with gold
		- Level of stronghold -> level of creeps produced
		- Level also -> stronghold HP
		- Damaged by enemy creeps (health regen in mean time) -> neutral "contested state" (no regen) -> back to level 1
		- Can be upgraded to spec into special types of creeps
			- Combinations of several strongholds need to converge into a wave of creeps
		- Give build permission over a (fixed?) radius
		- When stronghold dies, all allied structures die (not creeps?)
			- Cool explody animation and victory (or defeat) music
	- Tower slots
		- Pre-generated in world
		- Towers level up??
		- Specced with gold upgrades, just like strongholds
	- Gold
		- Gained (almost exclusively) by killing enemy creeps
		- Global, not tied to any stronghold
		- Lost if all strongholds are lost
	- Lanes
		- All lanes are pre-generated (??)
		- All bidirectional
		- No branching????
		- Control structures (built? pregenerated?) operated by stronghold owner
		- Enemy creeps also follow control structures?
	- Creeps
		- No collision with other creeps or towers, only strongholds and lane control structures
	- Spawning (New Game)
		- Need to spawn far enough for high level strongholds but close enough to interact
- Brainstorming
	- AoE buff shrines (destructible by creeps)
	- Resource over time structures?
		- Consume a tower slot
	- Build up a garrison of reserve troops (completely fill a lane) blocked off by a gate. Pressure plate (activated by enemy units) opens the reserve gate
		- Same strategy used to build large waves automatically and deploy them towards enemies
	- Events (neutral creep invasions, minibosses, etc)
	- Customization on a pixel-art level (within stronghold boundaries)
		- A maxed out stronghold, zoomed out on the map, looks like a circle with cool designs in it
	- Dev imposed acts of god to destroy rude pixel art 
- Engine
	- Discrete fixed tick-rate and positional grid
		- Any creep speed variation?
		- Client-side interpolation of position
	- Host machine specs must be able to handle 100% grid saturation
- Philosophy
	- Randomness
		- Enough RNG to force every stronghold to be designed according to the environment
		- BUT still enough options to allow complex tactics and mechanisms (wave building, reserves, etc)
	- Persistence
	- Flux
		- Will usually last overnight, but requires constant attention to remain stable (both due to neutral and enemy forces)
- Questions
	- what can creeps hit? other creeps? towers? specific power source?
	- what gives gold? only killing other creeps (neutral/pvp)?
	- what happens if two people are attacking the same objective? (miniboss/creep spawn)
		- 'contest' state like a neutral control point in an fps?
	- what limits creep mobility (why don't they go in a directoin forever)
		- passive DoT
		- DoT from hazards along the path
		- no limit
	- what do creeps do at unmarked intersections?
		- random per creep
		- random deterministic
		- no such intersections
		- player directed
	- can you route/manipulate neutral creeps?
	- what is the auxiliary dimension of the game?
		- resource gathering? (mining, farming, etc. civ-style)
		- aesthetics; customizing the area you control
	- should towers level-up on their own? be manually upgraded? both?
	- creeps buffing/supporting other creeps? (healers, tanks, etc)
		- Maybe avoid since everything should be automated, and is practically just a numbers game
		- Tactics should be more about routing then wave composition (?????)
	- spawning in waves or continuous?
		- I really like the idea of manual wave creation/manipulation
	- how to enemies interact with friendly lane control structures? (gates, barricades)
		- ignore completely, no collision
		- damage + destroy
	- if lane control structures must be build, where can they be built?
	- where can towers be built? is there a no-mans-land between player strongholds?
		- dynamic lane interactions within nomans land? buff gates and stuff?
	- same slots for towers and spawners?
		- Forces a choice between offense + defense (unless there is creep-v-creep combat)
	- should stronghold radius increase by level??
		- Probably not, complicates things like Civ city-growth where radii intersect
			- Solve by enforcing a max radius...
	- Need ability to clear a clogged lane/ delete all creeps in lane?
	- XP/level unlocks upgrades, which must be bought?
		- both xp and gp gate upgrades, or just gp?
		- only GP gates upgrades, and XP gates level
	- What prevents snowball? what protects noobs?
	- Any kind of cooperative interaction?
		- In a way, all conflict benefits both parties since it is the primary source of gold in the game
		- Stable configurations of creep-farming could be super-beneficial
		- In fact, destroying an enemy in such a configuration may result in *less* income overall
		- buuuut taking strongholds = growth (potentially exponential vs linear)
	- How to ensure power levels don't shift too drastically overnight
		- If a big wave is building up, you see it happening
		- You have to log in to spend
		- Strongholds resetting to level 1 protects defenders from offense snowball
		- What protects offense from defensive snowball? (stronghold defeated, reset to level 1, immediately smashed by the lvl 30 creeps from next door)
		- Some mechanic needs to enforce a cooldown period of almost ~24hrs before consecutive strongholds can fall???????
	- What's the point of a stronghold landlocked by all friendly strongholds?
		- Creeps can't even get out to enemy bases...
		- Solve this with factory/resource mining structures?
			- Build an empire with evolving military on the outsides and evolving economy on the inside
			- If this route is taken, should military or economy be the main generator of cash?
			- XP generated by military (towers killing creeeps), GP generated by economy (passive/vulernable resource structures), growth generated by military (offensive creeps)
- Post-MVP/blue sky
	- scalability/sharding?
	- monetization
		-freemium
		-microtransactions
			-creep skins, tower skins, banners
		-buy once? (doesn't seem to fit)
	- Name?

4/3

2 hrs dev (procgen)

procgen algo:
- init: randomly place an origin base
- repeat: randomly select a base to branch from
- random walk (with probabilistic turns + length) to next base
	- do not collide with other lanes, towers, bases, edges (if you do, discard entire lane and start over)
	- check that base is not within radius of other bases (check all for euclidian distance)
	- once lane is validated, add random towers adjacent to lane (within radius of each tower)
- stop when target towers achieved (or after a certain failure rate?)

longer term roadmap:
- procgen a map with bases, lanes, towers
- render to canvas with pan+zoom
- creep spawn and movement
- towershots
- base damage
- tower, creep, base UI
- levelling
...
- network code

fuck man i dont know what to do
